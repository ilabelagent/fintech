# Valifi Fintech Platform

## Overview
Valifi is a comprehensive standalone fintech application providing banking, investment, and financial services. This platform enables users to manage digital wallets, trade securities, invest in precious metals, and access various financial products through a single integrated interface.

## Recent Changes (v3.0.0)
**Major Refactor (November 23, 2025)**: Complete transformation from multi-system monorepo to standalone banking and financial services application.

### What Changed
- Removed 7 major system folders (blue_elites, LIGHTNING_MIGRATION, agents, deployment, etc.)
- Removed ~13 non-fintech client pages (trading bots, celebrity platform, publishing, etc.)
- Removed ~27 non-fintech server services
- Cleaned database schema from 3,293 lines to ~1,100 lines
- Reorganized into clean `/backend/src` and `/frontend/src` structure
- Focused entirely on fintech core: banking, investments, trading, and financial services

See `CHANGELOG.md` and `REMOVAL_CANDIDATES.md` for complete details.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Focus: Banking and financial services only - no mock data, production-ready code.
