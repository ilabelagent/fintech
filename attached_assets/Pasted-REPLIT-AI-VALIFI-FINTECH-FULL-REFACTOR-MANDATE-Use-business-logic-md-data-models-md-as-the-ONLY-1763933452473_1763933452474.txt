REPLIT AI — VALIFI FINTECH FULL REFACTOR MANDATE
(Use business-logic.md + data-models.md as the ONLY source of truth)

You are the Replit AI Lead Engineer for the Valifi Fintech Platform.

Your mission is to refactor the entire backend and UI to match EXACTLY the specifications found in:

📄 business-logic.md


business-logic

📄 data-models.md


data-models

These two documents are the authoritative source of truth for all features, rules, flows, database structure, and user experiences.

🚀 PHASE A — SYSTEM AUDIT (MANDATORY BEFORE CODING)

Backend Audit

Discover all routes, controllers, services, DB models currently in repo.

Compare each to the official models in data-models.md.

Produce a table:

Route

Matches spec?

Missing fields?

Wrong logic?

Needs replacement?

Frontend Audit

List all sidebar routes + pages + components.

Mark each as:

VALID (in business logic doc)

INVALID (not in doc → remove)

PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

Output:
“Valifi Audit Report (Backend + Frontend)”

🚀 PHASE B — REMOVE NON-FINTECH MODULES

DELETE the following across frontend + backend:

❌ Prayer Center
❌ Jesus Cartel Publishing
❌ Guardian Angel
❌ Quantum Computing
❌ Bot Marketplace
❌ Trading Bots Arsenal (unless truly coded)
❌ TWinn Celebrity
❌ VIP Forum
❌ Community Forum (unless business-logic.md allows it)
❌ Precious Metals (if not backed by spec)
❌ Digital Assets section if not implemented with real models
❌ Swap, CoinMixer, etc. unless real
❌ Any page showing “Kingdom”, “Holy”, “Prophetic”, etc.

ONLY KEEP PAGES that match business-logic.md.
Everything else must be deleted at UI, routes, imports, menus, and backend endpoints.

🚀 PHASE C — ENFORCE TRUE BACKEND MODELS EXACTLY AS IN data-models.md

Implement or correct these real models:

User

UserSettings

ActiveSession

Asset

InvestmentLog

Transaction

P2POffer

ValifiCard

Follow EXACT fields and ENUMs from:


data-models

ALL logic MUST USE the rules in:

🚀 PHASE E — WIRE ALL FEATURES TO UI (NO PLACEHOLDERS)

1. Exchange Platform

Must include:

Admin Procurement Alert

User verifies bank/wire details

🚀 PHASE F — FIX ROUTING & DEAD LINKS

Fix issues seen in user screenshots:

Digital Assets → 404 (fix or remove)

Orders failing to load (fix endpoint or frontend call)

Liquidity pools dead → remove or connect to real feature

Stock/Bond/Metal pages reading static demo data → replace with backend-driven data

🚀 PHASE G — PROFESSIONAL REBRAND

Replace all UI text containing:

“Kingdom”

“Holy”

“Prophetic”

With clean global fintech language:

“Valifi Fintech Platform”

“Portfolio Overview”

“Trading & Investment Services”

“Financial Operations Center”

🚀 PHASE H — RBAC IMPLEMENTATION

Use backend roles:

User

SuperAdmin

Frontend must enforce:

Admin-only views for KYC, loans, P2P disputes

User-only flows locked behind KYC

SuperAdmin dashboard only for system-level audit

🚀 PHASE I — FINAL VALIDATION

Replit must:

Run all build commands

Generate final migration

Ensure no unused imports

Ensure no 404 routes

Confirm UI → backend full data connectivity
